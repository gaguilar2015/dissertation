# Dissertation

This respository contains the entirity of the R code and syntax used during my dissertation for Salford Business School. The code can be found in the file named **diss_fullscript.R**

The dissertation is titled *E-Government Acceptance and Intention to Use: Analyzing Adoption Factors in the Belizean Context Using an Extended Technology Acceptance Model*. The study performed for this dissertation utilized primary data collected from a roughly representative sample of the Belizean Population. A survey-tool was adapted and validated using the **Technology Acceptance Model** as the foundation. The subsequently collected data underwent rigorous processing and analysis. The analysis performed on the data includes Exploratory Data Analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, and logistic regression. The logistic model was regressed on factor scores obtained from the CFA, a technique known as factor-score regression. 

The dissertation was approved and assigned a grade of 80, with particular praise for the design of the study and analysis of the data. The overall comments on the dissertation feedback read:

>This is a an extremely good, indeed high-quality piece of work throughout. There is the odd issue more from a process point of view for masters research, but in my view, the discussion and analysis are beyond that expected of a masters dissertation.  This is especially the case for the fieldwork design and analysis and this is reflected in the overall mark.  The work is well written, well referenced (using Harvard approach appropriately) and well executed and was a pleasure to read.
